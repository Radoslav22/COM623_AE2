## Introduction

The Student Time Helper aims to keep the student focused on their work and assignments and improve their time management skills. For the students interviewed in the previous paper, managing their time is challenging because they are juggling tasks or do not have the habits to organise their work well. As a result of the volume of assessments, students sometimes have trouble handling the pressure and managing their time effectively, resulting in lower grades. The application is simple and focused on time management to help the student achieve better grades. The application is primarily designed for mobile devices, based on the answers from my previous paper.

The web application is created using React, Firebase and the open-source React components library MUI (https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/). Professional tools and techniques are used and the application follows modern application standards. As the web application is intended to be used while doing assessments and different tasks, it is entirely mobile-friendly and specifically designed for devices with a width of 393 pixels. Although the React library is used and has responsive vision, it could also be used on a desktop version. Positive feedback was received from the Figma testing prototype and the prototype on Figma is followed to achieve the best of the app.



## Methodology

The methodology followed during the development phase was waterfall methodology (https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/waterfall#:~:text=The%20Waterfall%20methodology%20%E2%80%94%20also%20known,before%20the%20next%20phase%20begins.). Because of the scheduling by using waterfall process, the project will be kept within set time constraints to meet the deadline. The first two phases "Requirements" and "Design" of the methodology have been completed in my previous paper (AE1). The upcoming two stages "Implementation" and "Testing" are going to be followed during the implementation of this assessment (AE2), however, the final phase of the methodology "Maintenance" will be implemented in the future.

### Methods

The evaluation of the proposed solution will be based on collecting mixture of quallitative and quantitative data (https://www.simplypsychology.org/qualitative-quantitative.html) using online surveys which will follow the Solent University ethical consideration. All of the participants in the project are going to be carefully acquainted with the purpose of the survey and with the ethnical consideration of the university. All of the participants' responses will be anonymous and make sure that there are no real names or any other information with which the participant will be easily recognised. The Sample size of the survey is at least 15 participants. The target of participants is student which are currently studying at university. The survey will be shared on the social platforms to students in order to make sure the sample size target is met. 
Because of the limited time frame, it was not possible to conduct a longer study of the likelihood of the app solving the issue stated above. After collecting the data from the surveys, the results are going to be
